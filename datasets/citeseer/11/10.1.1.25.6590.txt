tuning weights metric recall metric involves linear combination terms 
section discuss set weights terms 
straightforward approach finding weights form multidimensional continuous optimization variables powell method evaluation function number queries ranked intended target upper database 
difficulty kind evaluation function fairly slow compute order seconds perform evaluation large number queries 
alternative approach assume regression model perform kind leastsquares fit data 
pair query target images record equation form depending query target intended match sum terms equation bucket variables unknowns square fit error term equality hold 
number problems method 
problem primarily aesthetic computed weights give results general fact may lie interval 
case left problem interpreting values mean 
second problem serious 
difficulty collecting data tuning weights easier create data mismatches matches database images query corresponds mismatches single match 
data squares fit tend give weights skewed finding mismatches best squares fit data query target pair score close 
alternative equal sized sets matched mismatched image pairs means throwing lot perfectly useful inexpensive data 
reasons approach statistics called logit model 
logit model assume regression model form called latent variable observed directly 
observed dummy variable defined ae idea logit model exists underlying continuous variable perceptual closeness images difficult measure directly 
continuous variable determines binary outcome image intended target query easily measured 
logit model provides weights compute probability produces positive outcome assumptions logit model probability query target pair match weights monotonic constant query target pairs suffices compute expression order rank targets order decreasing probability match 
compute weights logit procedure sas 
takes sas seconds ibm rs find appropriate weights input matches randomly chosen mismatches 
weights necessarily optimal respect preferred evaluation function appear give results computed quickly performing multidimensional continuous optimization directly
